# Hey there, 😀

I build web and mobile products with React Native, Next.js, and Node.js. I care about practical security and streamlined developer workflows. I ship tools and apps aimed at production use, not just demo-ware.

I also share solutions as an active Stack Overflow contributor to help fix problems instead of just scrolling past them. Find my profile [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/13633973/naandalist).
