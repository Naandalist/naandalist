### Hello people, Peace be upon you. Assalamu'alaikum.

![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=naandalist.naandalist)

### In order to defend and preserve the honor of the profession of computer programmers, I promise that, to the best of my ability and judgement that:

- I will not produce harmful code.
- The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate
- I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.
- I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself and others as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.
- I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.
- I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make a promise without certainty.
- I will never stop learning and improving my code.
